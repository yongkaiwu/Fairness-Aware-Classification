This is an implementation for [On Convexity and Bounds of Fairness-aware Classification, *Yongkai Wu, Lu Zhang, Xintao Wu*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3308558.3313723) in WWW'19.

# Development
1. Due to the compatibility of CVXPY, this implementation works on Linux.
2. Our implementation is based on Python 3.6.
2. The python distribution [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) or [Miniconda](https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/) is highly recommended. Since we utilize the environment management tool `conda`, Miniconda is minimal and sufficient.


# Reproduction
To re-produce this repository:
1.  Recover the environment by `conda env create --file conda-env.txt --name YOUR_ENV_NAME`.
2.  Go into the new environment and install `dccp` by `pip install dccp==0.1.6`.
3.  run `python main.py`.
